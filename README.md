    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am 21 years old, I have been studying programming since December 2022. I also study at KubSAU at the Faculty of Finance and Credit.
            I started my career as an android developer in May 2023. During this time I worked for AXAS. We were developing mvp versions of mobile applications. Afterwards, I moved to the Dostaevsky company as a middle android developer, where I work to this day.. All the technologies presented below are familiar to me and I work with them on an ongoing basis.
